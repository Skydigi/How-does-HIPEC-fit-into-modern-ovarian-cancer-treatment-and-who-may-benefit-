# How-does-HIPEC-fit-into-modern-ovarian-cancer-treatment-and-who-may-benefit-

In ovarian cancer, the peritoneum is commonly involved, making cytoreductive surgery central to care. HIPEC can be integrated for select patients—often at interval cytoreduction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or at primary debulking in experienced centers—to enhance control of microscopic peritoneal disease. Candidate selection weighs BRCA/HRD status, chemo response, disease distribution, performance status, and the likelihood of achieving complete cytoreduction. HIPEC’s heated, intraperitoneal delivery increases drug penetration where tumor cells reside while minimizing systemic exposure. Potential advantages include prolonged progression-free intervals and, in some contexts, overall survival improvement; careful discussion covers risks like fluid shifts, infection, and transient organ stress. Recovery follows ERAS principles, emphasizing early mobilization, VTE prevention, and nutrition. Post-op, systemic therapy and maintenance (e.g., PARP inhibitors when indicated) are planned with the tumor board. The aim is comprehensive, personalized care: the right surgery, smart integration of HIPEC, and evidence-based systemic therapy to maximize long-term outcomes and quality of life.
